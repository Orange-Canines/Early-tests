==================================
-- Level design 
==================================
-Open world 

- Do we actually need a map? or will having none give it a bigger adventure?

- have to set up a check point by clearing an area....
Rest/Heal, Inventory, Switch skins, NPC

-interconnected dungeons

- mid points , mid bosss  mid loot 

-randomness wether randomly generated or not.

- unattackable life 

- Random events in dungeons Like randomly charging bear, or.....

- Floors make the game feel deeper and scarier 

-trapppps 

- Hidden areas 

- one hidden boss?

- very few towns < 3
